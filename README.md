# Decentralized FIR Registration System

Welcome to the Decentralized FIR Registration System GitHub repository! This project aims to provide a secure and transparent platform for police departments to register FIRs (First Information Reports) using blockchain technology. By leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, this system ensures the immutability and transparency of FIR records, enhancing trust and accountability in the law enforcement process.

## Features

- **Blockchain Integration**: Utilizes Ethereum blockchain for storing FIR records, ensuring tamper-proof and transparent data storage.
- **Secure Registration**: Provides a secure and decentralized platform for police departments to register FIRs securely.
- **Transparency**: Enhances transparency in the FIR registration process by making all records publicly accessible on the blockchain.
- **Immutable Records**: Once registered on the blockchain, FIR records cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring data integrity.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Developed using React.js and Bootstrap for a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Ethers.js**: JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract language used to develop the smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Bootstrap**: Front-end framework for designing responsive and mobile-first websites.
